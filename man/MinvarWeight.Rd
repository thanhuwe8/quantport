\title{Calculate assets weights for minimum variance portfolio given target return}
\usage{
MinvarWeight(ret, covmat, target, short = TRUE, freq)
}
\arguments{
\item{ret}{a vector stores mean return of assets (\samp{N x 1}). A vector should store daily, monthly
or quarterly return.}

\item{covmat}{a matrix stores covariance matrix of asset returns. A matrix should be scaled by daily, monthly
or quarterly return alligned with `ret` vector.}

\item{short}{a boolean stores TRUE for short sale constraint or FALSE for no constraint}

\item{freq}{}

\item{rf}{a scalar store annualized risk free rate}
}
\description{
Compute the minumum variance portfolio given target return based on Quadratic Programming.
Short sale constraint could be used. Lower and upper bound could not be implemented by this function
